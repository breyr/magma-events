# Magma Events

Final project for CS306 at Arcadia University. 

## Assignment Description
Magma Events has a variety of events that it serves and a large staff to serve them.  The staff is classified in one of two ways: Server or Preparer.  Currently, on staff, we have eight preparers and twelve servers.  Typically, for one event, we need three preparers and six servers.  As you can imagine, setting a schedule is difficult between the many events that are occurring and the staff vacation days.  Currently, we schedule using a spreadsheet that tracks the events, the staff, counts the number of staff at each event AND calculates the salary cost of the event (sum of selected employee hourly rates time the length of the event).  The spreadsheet works well from an organizational standpoint, but we then need to transfer this information into individual schedules for each employee.  Additionally, we block out cells on the spreadsheet when our employees have vacation days scheduled, but we have to do that by hand.
